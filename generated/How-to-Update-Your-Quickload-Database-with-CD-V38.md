## Why Use Quickload?
 
Quickload is not just a data update disk, it is also a powerful and versatile software that can help you with many aspects of reloading and shooting. Quickload can help you:

- Choose the best powder and bullet combination for your cartridge and firearm.
- Estimate the velocity and pressure of your loads based on your barrel length, seating depth, ambient temperature and other factors.
- Compare different cartridges, powders and bullets on the basis of load density, muzzle energy, recoil, trajectory and wind drift.
- Create ballistic tables and range cards for your loads and print them out.
- Design your own cartridges and bullets and import them into Quickload for analysis.
- Interface with a chronograph to measure your actual velocities and compare them with Quickload's predictions.

Quickload is not a substitute for load manuals or common sense. You should always start with low loads and work up gradually, checking for signs of pressure. You should also verify your loads with actual shooting and chronographing. However, Quickload can save you time and money by narrowing down your choices and eliminating trial and error. It can also help you understand how different variables affect your loads and optimize them for your specific needs.
